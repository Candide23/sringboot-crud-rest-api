## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that helps developers build Spring-based applications quickly and easily.

The main goal of Spring Boot is to quickly create Spring-based applications without requiring developers to write the same boilerplate configuration again and again.

Spring Boot is a very popular framework for developing REST web services and microservices.
